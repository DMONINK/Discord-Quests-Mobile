# ⚠️ Project Status Update
This extension no longer works due to a recent update implemented by Discord, which breaks the existing functionality.
At this point, I’ve decided not to continue development. Fixing this would require significant rework, and I’m no longer willing to spend weeks maintaining this extension.
Thank you to everyone who used or supported this project.
Feel free to fork the repository if you’d like to continue development on your own.

# Discord Quest Helper (For Mobile)
Original Desktop script by [aamiaa](https://gist.github.com/aamiaa/204cd9d42013ded9faf646fae7f89fbb)

## How It Works
- The extension spoofs your user-agent to make Discord think you're using the desktop app.
- Works with `WATCH_VIDEO`, `WATCH_VIDEO_ON_MOBILE`, `PLAY_ON_DESKTOP`, `STREAM_ON_DESKTOP`, and `PLAY_ACTIVITY`.
- This also works with any Chromium-based browser on other devices.

## Installation
1. Download the [extension](<https://github.com/DMONINK/Discord-Quests-Mobile/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>).
2. Download [Kiwi Browser](<https://github.com/kiwibrowser/src.next/releases>).
3. Open the browser and navigate to `kiwi://extensions`.
   - Alternatively, tap the three dots menu and select "Extensions."
4. Enable `Developer mode`, then tap on `+ (from .zip/crx/.user.js)` and upload the extension that you downloaded.
5. Now open the [Discord Quests page](<https://discord.com/quest-home>), accept at least one quest, and refresh the page.
   - You will be able to see a `🚀 Run Quest Code` button. Click on it and enjoy!

**Note:** This setup is optimized for mobile using Kiwi Browser, which supports Chrome extensions.
