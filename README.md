# Discord Quest Helper (For Mobile)
Original script by [aamiaa](https://gist.github.com/aamiaa/204cd9d42013ded9faf646fae7f89fbb)

## How It Works
- The extension spoofs your user-agent to make Discord think you're using the desktop app.
- Works with `WATCH_VIDEO`, `WATCH_VIDEO_ON_MOBILE`, `PLAY_ON_DESKTOP`, `STREAM_ON_DESKTOP`, and `PLAY_ACTIVITY`.
- This also works with any Chromium-based browser on other devices.

## Installation
1. Download the [extension](<https://github.com/DMONINK/Discord-Quests-Mobile/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>).
2. Download [Kiwi Browser](<https://github.com/kiwibrowser/src.next/releases>).
3. Open the browser and navigate to `kiwi://extensions`.
   - Alternatively, tap the three dots menu and select "Extensions."
4. Enable `Developer mode`, then tap on `+ (from .zip/crx/.user.js)` and upload the extension that you downloaded.
5. Now open the [Discord Quests page](<https://discord.com/quest-home>), accept at least one quest, and refresh the page.
   - You will be able to see a `🚀 Run Quest Code` button. Click on it and enjoy!

**Note:** This setup is optimized for mobile using Kiwi Browser, which supports Chrome extensions.
